# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio for KU coding bootcamp assignment.

For this assignment I re-coded the entire portfolio, both html and css to be more consistent with what I've learned and what the assignment called for. Media Queries were added for responsiveness, and html syntax became more standardized with modern HTML 5 guidelines. The portfolio still contains an About page, a Portfolio page with items, and a Contact page with contact form.

The assignment is a recode from the previous <a href="https://github.com/realSenses/Basic-Portfolio">Basic Portfolio</a>, and a foundation for the follow up assignment <a href="https://github.com/realSenses/Bootstrap-Portfolio">Bootstrap Portfolio</a>.
