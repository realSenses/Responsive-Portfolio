# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio for KU coding bootcamp assignment.

For this assignment I essentially re-coded the entire portfolio, both html and css to be more consistent with what I've learned and what the assignment called for. Media Queries were added for responsiveness, and html syntax became more standardized with modern HTML 5 guidelines.
