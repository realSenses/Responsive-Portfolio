			For the past 4 years I've worked in the mental health field, trying my best to help people through the hard times that life throws at us all. It's amazingly rewarding at its best, and often challenging and draining at it's worst. Whenever I need to relax, I watch a lot of movies, make art in photoshop, listen to electronic music, and browse the internet satisfying my curiosity. An endlessly curious mind tends to turn into a creative one, and I'd say that fits me pretty well.

			At some point, I had the idea to combine electronic music and the curiosity one has while browsing the internet. After a few months of googling and poking my keyboard, I made succeeded in making a website! Well, a music blog if you want to be technical. It lives at <a href="http://tentaclesound.com" target="_blank">TentacleSound.com</a>. I know it's got a weird name, but I really like octopus. Like alot. It's my next tattoo idea. Ok?
		</p>

			While building my website, I discovered just how awesome coding was, and I decided web development was my future. I still work in mental health for now, but only long enough to learn the fundamentals of coding and jumpstart a new career in web development.  Strangely enough my relaxation repertoire now includes learning how to build awesome things that live online, and I can't wait to see what I make next!
